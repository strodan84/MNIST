# Handwritten Digit Recognition using TensorFlow

This project implements a handwritten digit recognition model trained on the classic MNIST dataset using TensorFlow. The model leverages deep neural networks to accurately classify digits from 0 to 9.

## Features

- **Dataset**: MNIST, containing 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images of handwritten digits.
- **Model**: Deep neural network built with TensorFlow.
- **Accuracy**: Achieves high accuracy on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/handwritten-digit-recognition.git
   cd handwritten-digit-recognition
